# Readme

The repository contains the files I use to configure a new installation of MacOS to my liking.

Some things it handles is pyenv with conda environments, using zim, zplug, and neovim.

# Pull Requests

Should someone think of a better way to handle a portion of this installation, a pull request or feature suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
